# Project agent instructions
## Codex: reddit_hackathon_games working agreements
- Treat the newest handover/status in the workspace brain as authoritative.
- After ANY meaningful change, append an entry to cooperation_documentation.md (append-only): Intent + Outcome + commands + tests + commit/worktree.
- Prefer Codex worktrees for parallel tasks; avoid editing on main checkout unless it’s trivial.
- Before deploy/publish steps: run the repo checks (lint/typecheck/tests if present).
- Publish unlisted unless public listing is explicitly required.
