You are Codex continuing work in:
/Users/cosmopax/Desktop/projx/reddit_hackathon_games/.worktrees/codex-solo-completion

Read first:
1) AGENTS.md
2) CODEX_HANDOVER_5.md
3) cooperation_documentation.md (latest entries)
4) docs/demo_post_checklist.md

Current state:
- 4-game completion sprint implemented.
- All four apps uploaded and submitted for Devvit review.
- Smoke is green (`bash scripts/smoke_all_games.sh`).

Your mission now:
1) Keep branch stable and review-ready.
2) Handle any review feedback with minimal-risk patches.
3) Keep docs/demo assets aligned with final app behavior.
4) After each meaningful change, append cooperation_documentation.md.

Hard constraints:
- Do not regress smoke.
- Do not change publish mode to listed unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve installation-scoped settings workaround.
