Happy developing, and we’ll see you next year with more updates and payouts.

When [u/thejohnnyr](https://www.reddit.com/user/thejohnnyr/) first started coding, he wasn’t dreaming of millions of players or thriving online communities. He was just trying to make his own version of Pokémon. Years later, after a detour into software engineering, he quit his job to chase game development full-time — and ended up building one of Reddit’s most beloved community games: [_Honk_](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgames/).

![Play honk](/docs/assets/images/honk_1-1971cacd52b7b27d53cf27df7e9d64d7.gif)

Today, Honk has more than **300,000 subscribers** , a passionate community of creators, and players who spend hours designing or conquering levels. We talked with Johnny to learn more about his journey, his experience building for Reddit, and what’s next for _Honk_.

## From side projects to full-time game development​

Johnny’s path to game dev wasn’t a straight line. After dabbling in coding games in college, he pursued a more traditional software engineering career. But two years ago, he decided to take the leap:

“On a whim, I jumped into building games full time! I wasn’t making any money, but picked up contract software work on the side to pay the bills. I chose web platforms because I love that web games are accessible to anyone, without downloads or installs. Plus, it’s a fun challenge to optimize for performance since players load the game fresh every time.” 

  

That passion for accessibility and optimization laid the foundation for what would become his breakout success.

## Discovering Reddit’s Developer Platform​

Johnny stumbled across Reddit’s new Developer Platform, [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/), in his own feed. At the time, he had already been experimenting with web games for two years.

When Reddit announced a hackathon, he decided to give it a shot — and won first prize with _Chook_ , a 3D low-poly multiplayer game where Redditors work together to feed a virtual chicken.

“This was my first hackathon ever, and I put a ton of work into Chook over three weeks. Winning felt incredible. It gave me the confidence to try something even bigger.” 

  

That “something bigger” arrived just days later.

## The birth of Honk​

Fresh off the [hackathon win](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/comments/1jwwzsq/announcing_the_winners_of_hack_reddit/), Johnny hacked together another game over a weekend. His goal? A simple spin on _Honk_ , designed to feel “Reddit-y,” with a live leaderboard that would draw players in.

What started as a small experiment quickly evolved into a thriving ecosystem:

  * **User-generated levels** : Redditors can design and share their own Honk courses.

  * **Cosmetics and quests** : Players can customize their goose and unlock challenges.

  * **Community-driven updates** : Feedback from players directly shapes new features.

“Some days I spend the entire day just coding new Honk features. It’s addictive — every time I release an update, the community response is amazing.” 

  

The numbers speak for themselves: over 300,000 subscribers and countless hours poured into custom levels.

## The power of user-generated content​

Johnny credits Honk’s explosive growth to one feature: the **level builder**.

“I launched the game with just classic mode and was getting decent traction. But once I added the level builder, things really took off. People immediately started creating a new level every minute — and using game objects in ways I never expected. That fresh content kept pulling in new users through Reddit’s feed algorithm.” 

  

From self-playing “auto levels” to creative story-driven challenges, the ingenuity of Redditors has kept the game fresh and endlessly re-playable.

![Honk with cow](/docs/assets/images/honk_2-5026fc661498c411ba02777af186c8d1.gif)

Check out some of Johnny’s favorite player-made levels:

  * [The Doom of the Kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGames/comments/1mhhjpa/the_doom_of_the_kittens/)

  * [Save the Train](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1mm2lr8/save_the_train_and_clear_the_tracks/)

  * [No Swimming](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1mukqlf/no_swimming/)

  * [Let the Clouds Guide You](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlappyGoose/comments/1m6rh6y/let_the_clouds_guide_you/)

## Keeping it free and fun​

Monetization is always a tricky question for indie developers. For Johnny, the answer was simple:

“I wanted to keep Honk totally free to play, with no pay-to-win features. Players can earn gems and feathers just by playing, but for those who don’t have time to grind, there’s an option to buy cosmetics. It supports development without compromising fairness.” 

  

That decision has kept the community happy — and growing.

## Building with Reddit​

Beyond the player community, Johnny highlights Reddit’s Developer Platform team as a key partner in _Honk_ ’s success.

“The Reddit team has been fantastic. They’ve helped with promotion, infrastructure, bug fixes, even hotfix approvals at odd hours. Honestly, all I’ve had to do is focus on building the game.” 

  

That support, paired with Reddit’s built-in network effects, makes the platform a dream for indie developers looking to find an audience.

## Advice for aspiring Reddit game devs​

For other developers considering Reddit’s Developer Platform, Johnny has some clear advice:

  * **Embrace UGC** : “User Generated Content is your friend.”

  * **Think mobile-first** : Most players will be on phones.

  * **Launch early** : Don’t wait for perfection — test ideas quickly and see what sticks.

And above all:

“Absolutely go for it! Even if your game doesn’t blow up, you can still reach new audiences and potentially earn money. Compared to past projects that went undiscovered, Reddit is magnitudes better.” 

## Looking ahead​

With _Honk_ soaring, Johnny’s eyes are on the future — not just for his game, but for Reddit’s developer ecosystem.

“I’d love to see Reddit host a convention or meetup for developers. Meeting fellow devs and the team in person would be amazing.” 

  

Until then, he’ll keep building, updating, and honking forward — one goose at a time.

As part of our efforts to spotlight developer insights, we interviewed a Staff Engineer on the Developer Platform team, [Marcus Wood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwood23), about building cross-platform apps on Reddit’s Developer Platform. Marcus has been integral in developing games (like our April Fools day experience, [r/Field](https://www.reddit.com/r/Field/)) and tools for iOS, Android, and web.

Below are the key takeaways from our interview, where he shared his perspective on designing for Reddit’s unique environment—one that rewards mobile-first design and thrives on user-generated content.

Devvit apps work across Reddit platforms to ensure all users can enjoy developer creations, no matter how or where they access our communities. However, this can often pose issues for developers trying to deliver a performant and consistent experience.

# Why Mobile-First is Important

A majority of Reddit’s logged-in user base accesses the platform via mobile. For developers building cross-platform experiences, this should be an indicator and a north star for designing. Developers should prioritize touch-first UX, optimize for mobile performance, and design interactive elements — especially around “thumb zones” for games.

Marcus also offered a few go-to mobile UX tips that have seen success across the platform:

  * Larger tap targets (44x44px) in games/experiences
  * Placing key buttons near the bottom of the screen (thumb-friendly)
  * Use in-game overlays and tutorials to educate users ([Ducky Dash](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGames/) is a great example)

# Integrate with Reddit, but Don’t Spam

Reddit is a _surprised Pikachu meme_ opinionated ecosystem of communities and users. So Marcus cautioned against spammy tactics like flooding comment threads with things like auto-progress updates with games. Instead, he recommended meeting users “where they are”—for example, prompting subreddit subscriptions within the game or encouraging comments only after an “aha” moment like completing a game level.

# Build with UGC in Mind

User-generated content is a game changer for your game being discovered on Reddit. For instance, [Flappy Goose](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditGames/)’s level builder and [Karma Crunch](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCrunch/)’s avatar customizer are prime examples of apps that encouraged community creativity. “Apps that lead to more posts are the ones that win.”

Reddit’s feeds generally reward fresh and engaging content, regardless of platform, and your app can help generate that. Additionally, Reddit’s biggest advantage is community. It's full of creative, engaged users who will run with whatever building blocks you give them.

“Build tools, not just toys,” Marcus advised. “The most magical moments happen when users do the unexpected.”

# Testing and Performance

Performance on Reddit isn't about smooth animations—it's about efficiency at scale. Apps like our April Fool's r/[Field](https://www.reddit.com/r/Field/) optimized bandwidth through bit-packing rather than device rendering. Knowing that he recommends:

  * Batching requests to reduce load
  * Using Redis for real-time features over constant polling
  * Minimizing unnecessary network chatter

Make sure you’re doing your best to monitor and test performance across as many devices as possible. If you don’t have access to testing your app on some platforms, we recommend requesting platform-specific feedback as part of [Feedback Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/comments/1lwfsuo/introducing_feedback_friday_on_rdevvit/).

Some important things to be mindful of when testing:

  * Platform and device light mode/dark mode settings
  * Responsiveness on mobile devices
  * Text and component sizes based on device and accessibility settings
  * Also (shameless plug) to use our new [UI simulator](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/ui_simulator)

# Final Advice for Aspiring Reddit Game Devs

For developers looking to get started:

  * Build apps with the mobile experience in mind
  * Focus on apps that drive new content (user generated content is a great way to achieve this)
  * Use popular frameworks
  * Avoid overly complex or unorthodox implementations

Tokyo-based game studio [Cabbage Systems (キャベツ・システムズ合同会社)](https://www.cabbagesystems.com/) is no stranger to experimentation. Originally formed from a desire to build games in new places online — Reddit turned out to be a perfect fit. We caught up with their team to hear how they approached building their latest game on Reddit, how they leaned into the platform's unique culture, and what they learned along the way.

## A Gourmet Frog, Reddit-Style​

Cabbage began experimenting with Reddit games during a small prototype project, [r/DarkDungeonGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkDungeonGame), and saw potential for something bigger.

> "We knew we wanted to go a lot bigger this time—something with the potential to sustain itself through monetization but that would also really work with the grain of how Redditors use Reddit."

After researching what types of games resonated with Reddit’s communities, they landed on an idle RPG format, with bite-sized gameplay loops that users could engage with throughout their feed.

That’s when the team asked a game-changing question: “Why are characters in these games always walking to the right? Where are they going?”

Their answer: Dinner of course!

Enter: a sword-fighting gourmet frog, battling through monsters on a mission for his next meal → [r/SwordAndSupperGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwordAndSupperGame/).

# Building on Reddit with Devvit

Cabbage leaned fully into Reddit’s developer platform and the new webview-powered interactive posts. Their tech stack includes React for UI and Phaser for the game viewport, all built on top of [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/devvit_web/devvit_web_overview).

> "We were very happy with the way these pieces fit together."

They also invested early in developer infrastructure, setting up a smooth continuous integration pipeline with GitHub and a private subreddit for QA testing. This attention to tooling paid off — and now the Cabbage team ships with confidence.

# Designing with the grain of Reddit

Cabbage wasn’t just building a game on Reddit — they built a game for Reddit.

Their design centers on interactive posts: each mission in the game is its own post, created by a user and discoverable anywhere across the platform. In the Sword and Supper game your character persists across missions, gaining XP, loot, and abilities.

> "We believed intuitively that our game should live everywhere throughout a user's feed."

User-generated content is opt-in but highly encouraged, especially for discovery and growth of the community on Reddit. Mission creators can write short story intros and taunts for their enemies — with results ranging from witty burns to a full copy-paste of the Bee Movie script.

# Growing a Community

Cabbage’s launch strategy was as much about building a player community as it was about shipping the game.

They started with a small closed beta subreddit of a few hundred players who understood the game was in active development. Once ready, those beta testers seeded the early access subreddit, helping onboard waves of new users organically.

> "Once post discovery turned on, new users started streaming in and found an already active community."

This phased approach paid off. As the game scaled, so did its player base and content ecosystem. Cabbage was also active in their community – posting updates and interacting with the redditors who loved their game.

# Monetization, the Reddit Way

Cabbage integrated Reddit’s Payments API shortly after Early Access for it began. But rather than push aggressive monetization, they took a community-first approach.

Players can buy premium maps that create special missions — but everyone can play them.

> "Generosity is a deep part of the Reddit ethos… and we took that into mind with Sword and Supper. With payments it's been a real win-win for us, the community, and players."

They were pleased to find the API integration itself was smooth, and players appreciated the ability to give back in a way that benefited the whole community.

# Advice for Other Developers / Studios

To studios considering Reddit as a platform, Cabbage says:

> "It's the perfect time to experiment with new ways to get your stuff in front of players."

With traditional funding and distribution models in flux, Reddit offers a new way to launch games and build community-driven momentum from day one.

As for what they’re hoping for next?

> "The biggest thing we're excited for is for more Redditors to know that games, including ours, are on Reddit and to give them a try!"

# The TL;DR for Cabbage Systems Success:

  * Game Concept: An idle RPG featuring a sword-fighting frog chef, designed to feel native to Reddit posts and feed.
  * User Generated Content: Lean into the creativity of redditors to spread your content and games with UGC as a core aspect.
  * Tech Stack: React, Phaser, and Devvit + Reddit’s webviews and Payments API.
  * Launch Strategy: Closed beta > Early Access subreddit > full discovery rollout.
  * Monetization: Community-beneficial premium content through Reddit Payments API.
  * Reddit Fit: Deep integration with Reddit’s UX, culture, and community interaction.

# More On Skyboard

Skyboard is a collaborative, city-builder game powered by Reddit’s developer platform and built using Bolt. This app transforms the r/Skyboard subreddit into a living, breathing digital landscape — where Redditors drop tiles, construct buildings, and shape the world together.

The result? A minimalist, endlessly scrolling MMO where your subreddit is the game world. There’s no download, no launcher — just your browser and your imagination.

Play it today: [r/Skyboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skyboard/)

# The Silly Sh!t Challenge

The _Silly Sh!t Challenge_ within the hackathon asked developers to embrace the weird and wonderful:

  * _Build the silliest, strangest, most delightfully useless thing possible using Reddit x Bolt._

Skyboard nailed it by taking something familiar — the city-builder genre — and reimagining it in a Reddit way. It's a game built entirely out of community, creativity, and a bit of chaos.

# More on the Hackathon

The [_World's Largest Hackathon_](https://worldslargesthackathon.devpost.com/), presented by Bolt, brought together thousands of developers to _build with AI and Bolt_ for a shot at $1M+ in prizes. From tools to games to complete absurdities, the event celebrated boundary-pushing builds. Additionally, Reddit runs a ton of hackathons throughout the year with cash prizes and if you're interested in keeping up with the latest you should join our developer community on r/[devvit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Devvit/).

# Build Today

Reddit's Developer Platform + Bolt makes it easy to bring games, tools, and weird experiments to life — all within Reddit where online communities thrive. So whether you want to build the next big tower defense game or just something fun for your community, now's the time.

Check out [developers.reddit.com](https://developers.reddit.com/) to get started.

In November 2023, I launched the first version of [Pixelary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixelary/), a simple drawing and guessing game built using [Reddit’s developer platform](https://developers.reddit.com/).

As a designer, I’m particularly interested in how the developer platform can foster new experiences for Reddit’s users. The platform enables the creation of everything from interactive games in post units to sophisticated moderation tools, allowing communities to personalize their spaces through code—and turning code itself into content.

What began as a hackathon project has evolved into a thriving game, attracting more than 65,000 subscribers. The insights gained from building Pixelary extend beyond game design, offering valuable lessons for creating engaging, scalable experiences in any context.

# Create a content flywheel

Posts on Reddit fade away from the feed after a few days. If a game’s lifespan is longer, it needs to continuously produce content to maintain engagement.

In Pixelary, every interaction creates new content: drawing produces new posts and guessing generates comments, which boosts visibility across Reddit. This “content flywheel” ensures that Pixelary remains visible and engaging—more content means more interaction, and more interaction leads to more content.

# Create a distinctive first screen

In a feed, user attention is fleeting. If your post looks the same every time, it risks being ignored as a repost.

For Pixelary, I focused on showcasing the drawings. The first screen changes with every post, which offers users a new visual to engage with and prevents the sense of repetition. The more unique and intriguing the first screen, the more likely it is that users will stop scrolling and start playing.

# Make calls to action clear and focused

A game is only as good as its ability to get users to take an action. In Pixelary, I narrowed the focus to just a few key actions: submitting drawings and commenting. This simplicity helps reduce decision fatigue and encourages players to engage with the game on a deeper level. The game was designed to direct attention toward the most valuable interactions—those that contributed to the game’s ongoing content creation and distribution.

# Build for N players

Pixelary is an asynchronous game. Players don’t need to be online at the same time to enjoy it.

This flexibility allows for a scalable experience. As the user base grows, we don’t want the game to be limited by the number of people playing at any given moment.

Asynchronous mechanics reduce the commitment threshold—players can hop in, contribute a guess, and leave. The increased volume of guesses and drawings only improves the overall game experience, as it increases the variety and quality of posts.

This approach also means that players don’t need to dedicate large chunks of time to enjoy the game, making it easier for the user base to expand.

# Moderation through accountability

In any community, moderation is key to maintaining a healthy, engaging experience. By pairing usernames with their actions—whether drawing or commenting—Pixelary encourages accountability and helps reduce trolling, creating a safer space for users to interact.

# Scaling with Devvit

As Pixelary grew, I quickly realized that the way data was stored couldn’t keep up with the increased traffic. Initially, I stored all post data in a single object, but this approach became too slow. To fix it, I broke the data into smaller, more efficient pieces, optimizing how we queried the system. This change allowed Pixelary to scale and handle the growing user base more effectively.

Another challenge was the performance of Reddit’s legacy APIs. Some calls were slow, especially for international users, which led to slow load times and increased unsubscribe rates. Caching responses helped speed up the system, but it was a constant balancing act between performance and user experience.

# Working within constraints

Reddit's design system (RPL) presented challenges and opportunities. For example, RPL didn’t support a custom typeface, so I built a tool to convert text strings into a [pixel font](https://developers.reddit.com/play#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-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-fxEPIw0-AwEEbX4Gg4k2tgzt6xmwgjWbBuW1bzMmwq0JUN7VtW2LmCCuJixEEw8AWEE8eBQAzKyrDdMoMo2pngvC6zVuTlr7FASu9asgAVvg3huh6VPI9R2fdPnluUTXrn3PF4OmJtrUQCZADCagdBISD4B0JzhESGENJAsBtFIABy0AwFIKv8m8ChUG0AD6BrbBcU7bg0N2PndlvUTwHRqiGZvif6mcAKQsdgOssbfNoPyALjaN0YA8l9LEaPgIgRAJCPyaCZHo4kZJUGeo-DQapujiAxHIXuioqDiQAMQygACzYOwY-K84kKAAy0ixRuIdsDUScEQS+BCWJEOqizEAZDyEUMpISdgNNvoAFZhAB1YOJIITxtikPqlpfAdc2HUmYVbOuVC1TSNrnIrq+VCHEMYQomRki96cOADwyEgcBFCJekw5arAXgSPQASKRhtWGWKpNoqU3DeGoIwUWLBXDM6kM3hY447CNGzlkRfLq-i67n2ocEwial+TgzikiCqMFnCpEntgFiNoWJtGSQ0FidEHDpJSSAWmXCXa1X9AANX9LVG0pSuElNKSeWqXDqm1RPOUhppSbQAC1aZYOwBUmUpTE61UTqUrBtV+k1KwQMoZpSZS1Umf6DpLEV47hYhFPJJ5lmzhYr9PJAB2e4ghNkvzyZk-JOS8ksW6cU-pFSymzPGZUupzSmmTM6UswiqzUbrM2VkkAOyEDYH2dEo5IAZQnI+SAc5ALLn+mKY0ipLTZmNMGZM0ZwyaktPqVUmpZTRn9MGcM2Z8yxkzMebc9piyyAQrWQCjZEL-ltCBfhEFidwXmWyTxC5BTnY2meRUxpRKpmNNGS0mpjT6llJqVUvFLyRnTMGf02ZwyKlVLeVS9lIAaVtDpRqhlgKDkgqwWylZkLOXQoKUU3lyqSWzLKYM7F0z6mNIxXKxpnTaYymwMMtFUyZSUp+fkrV2AdUmr1UyzUIKuHGq2aa+i5raZnl5VUlFTT+mjIdWUp1TSWmDIFSShFFL3kaqDSGmNYaDX3BYieaNvyoVtBhXC1piq2mDNFW0iVTSqnkvdZ6iZvrqn+upV82lAbtlmz2RW-kLF9kAtORyuN9buXFMRS2uZcrhkdplQS0lxLVWDuLcO7Vo6-njoBeGw5laQCKxrWcs1i7CnFLKSq0ldrHk4qec655ubSUtP5RSq5yKSUTK6T0+5rTJl+qLSaktx7y3AsvQAThvfO3J8bYW8vhc80Zn7Jkdpqd6tdgy7lktqT27Agq+kzP3dBw9wbYOnsZZO35MZkOxtQ-ez1vLiV5sxWump-SsUvqbf+z1aa133OozGmD9KGP6vg1OkAbVWN1vyQ+pNH7s1Cp-a0t1IGvVAcI100T4HSWQfVTRjM3yZOfQnfJ35vdlN3tU+htpBaKMGdRc8sVTzJUkbKWq490ndWyfPSCzgjmF2qZ6ep+pkzvMitJZh15emlXCfw3KiDknflBdDSFpj+T2QRfY6pxNjz6ltvxW0sDBaAtDssyO6zSZbPMsvbgIrXLaY8r5Ta1dAnHm1YPfVo9jXFjNYjZeqw7W0PLrS2un1rafOdtaf5rLgbaOlt+XBlrCnapTfvV15trznmxf7YJgbFnIsbfyVt8bCmACSe3VNdd-Xx47b7839dW58obdGRtEDGxehTDJHuXNK3Fkl6ammZraS687Un1v0Zs2e-LLEADSIOCmcbKxD6ZfbytNOFeJ1zzyuOtMJSSuH2WEd-YByCgAMhjj1xSqn4-44W8z8OftXbHUjxjdnVOM4O2TndOn2m1V2RplN82SVna+5q2juzEdNeR-zlic9BfXOF4K3lvHwcEb63uqDnPLtK9Gyr7bvz8yM8tbU5976s0ur-e6nplG+0LKN1Trnpv-vm9u78pAGuWc48Ay9t1lSjO9KmcSszgXqfBd53Ji3+SACK1vH2tIzU89Fa7WdtIS07vTrvpmjPmXLnLZa8uq5AMlQPTyxPZ9w151doexfO96SSlN7uOee5NzT33gPfkREZy5zDzaQ8E8W32ojpKu2kbL3H3LCfQuXpOIz0rs++vEpaZTtbXu+986TyxGWgePNi944b7vu-e-x+Vwfv3+TSmM6x9K2pbOTvxZJ3Nin8+9837N3fgffJZaE-SrcnSZb9XlCXB3L-bPA3dnWPH7RXffRPe-FiZkEAkXHXRLOVXXOVOA0ZYjC-BA6-RfW-FAwAliAATSf2ZyEwVSeXAKq0-wg2-w9yv2K25xPSXxRxAEpQyQhRU1B1oIqXJ0q1xWxwq3XSj2wJqx-xIIr24KrwgGH3bx40n0eQIOkNtXKQj3B08xjzq3kM20r0PxAA0BoJixhy-SYP6Tb3oKnzkI4O91p0vRoBUL-TA28zw0eW0K72IOKy4WcP7xBVMlnQEKcyENJ20PtShyeW3wjynyA0cKsz-x9wAJBWMX4I1UEIKVhQ8KwwM3FVfx8NtwjxTTA0TmSIa1SJcIUxEDT15RuVqVmWTVqXqWGW-VSwLzYO+0i0COQOXwU01jCOyIiNyPb140aV2Wx3B3EKqV8N0KJzTSqOGxqOCMvWKznTYw6yFyRSmVwPoNlx6Pl1-1IP-3IJBRQEZ0TnIzFyfWmRaKmV8yDz1yo2OKDSwSCPSMvVLmuNuIwy13bTXWmKD0JRWOwH6LWO+IUzSAwO3T2KlysNwPSxlSOMv16KcIGJ4MYSyJNRyM62KQbyeUz2fR3wxLyU+KxKrygA10o3cxXSgLz1e312JJ0PeIVy+IuMvTMBGLxLGIJPyNwLA0Ez8MMMxKhK5IU3wHcKYLbSKOeKEwWSZz7U8PBM4JuwoMhVpNKWmIeUJxXUwzIzExYIMMGyMOuxMNQJAAAEc1929CC5VfNJlpjf0I9jTTM1TOTBjfkqBaTZStCZcyVPSqTTCKAZSV1Kt9SJ9BM+1NCYiFj2TTiFCyDvT8k0iD5b1ItLlosPt5iDMN0m8WCXtktEzzSecUyeC1A-SHkt91Cu1gyJTUyWIeAaDn1NC39XsoyKl9C2T0STiyyuCKyq8QheSY18TnZKN4TCNicJcEt39HValIdRSzTiskDGyeC0BqyRc3NV1PNP1kTAzM8t1migzSzxSzj0ymyQBbAtyS9Wk5SGCdTsds85jez-CUiLzajfl-g-SDTpCfUXUYzFyO8HjTy+zy9jDFDTDN4Ncii20yT+zzzkzzirzdANcCMc1w8zyPzkLLyeDWQNdG8xMEKg05QQyrSVZRza1+SbjNDBNdSs8RlwTE4vSeCiQGiPsHT2zAycM8Dty2kSLaNITPz1iFM1IqLMzitLkbj1NyVUtuLQTZVsN+LhlBKfthLcKvz8kkILCNC68lsZU1LIsyL1yq9DxWzpyWk7z6liL+1lyLskLIKhzTCxoZTydMMJdZlMLFYcCmlGTP0CzfNbL6CEzwLaNlZyLNSgQOL7i8ymiWCOiIdHy2c7zOjutdNsLqiRLoSO5kRUQPAYA9g9J2Au4SByAHJ6wcQwAEB-RBAgA). It wasn’t a major change, but it helped reinforce Pixelary’s identity and gave it a unique feel.

Constraints—whether technical, design, or platform-based—force us to think more creatively and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

# What’s next?

Pixelary is far from finished. There’s still much to explore, including:

  * A smarter dictionary for more dynamic guessing.
  * Enhanced drawing tools, like drag-to-draw and a broader color palette.
  * A deeper progression system.
  * More community-driven events and experimental game modes.

These ideas are just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep improving the game. You can dive into the open-source code for Pixelary [here](https://github.com/reddit/devvit/tree/main/packages/apps/pixelary).
