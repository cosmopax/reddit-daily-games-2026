Unleash your creativity and build engaging games inside Reddit communities with Devvit's powerful platform. [Earn money](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/27958169342996-Reddit-Developer-Funds-2025-Terms) as players engage with your games.

Devvit is Reddit’s developer platform for building interactive, cross-platform games and apps that run natively on Reddit.

[Devvit Web](/docs/capabilities/devvit-web/devvit_web_overview) lets you build Devvit apps using standard web technologies—like React, Three.js, or Phaser—so you can use familiar tools and frameworks to create games for Reddit. It supports a traditional client/server split, and makes it easy to bring modern web games to Reddit using the tools you already know.

## Why build games on Reddit?​

Reddit is home to millions of communities, each with its own culture and interests. With Devvit, you can create games that:

  * Earn money through Reddit Gold payments and [Reddit Developer Funds](/docs/earn-money/reddit_developer_funds)

  * Free hosting through our platform
