With the introduction of [inline webviews](/docs/capabilities/server/launch_screen_and_entry_points/view_modes_entry_points), Devvit Web is now the recommended approach for all interactive experiences that need in-feed interactions or pop-out views.

The Blocks documentation below remains to support developers maintaining existing apps built with Blocks.

Devvit Blocks is a framework that allows you to build apps with Reddit native components. Blocks is optimized for speed and ease of use, but is not recommended for games due to technical constraints and limitations.

warning

With the introduction of [0.12.2](/docs/changelog#devvit-0122-inline-mode-launch-screensexpanded-app-experiences-and-developer-logs), you can now render apps directly within the feed using Devvit Web. This makes Devvit Web the recommended path for all new projects.

## Examples​

### [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)​

Wall Street Bets's daily thread tracks stock performance and discussion on r/wallstreetbets. It's able to render in the feed quickly, and refresh automatically as new data is available.

## Available blocks​

We support the following elements:

### Containers​

  * **Blocks**
  * [**HStack**](/docs/blocks/stacks)
  * [**VStack**](/docs/blocks/stacks)
  * [**ZStack**](/docs/blocks/stacks)

### Objects​

  * [**Text**](/docs/blocks/text)
  * [**Button**](/docs/blocks/button)
  * [**Spacer**](/docs/blocks/spacer)
  * [**Image**](/docs/blocks/image)
  * [**Icon**](/docs/blocks/icon)

Further elements (components) may be derived from these blocks, and obey the same rules.

## Sizing​

### Paddings and gaps​

  * We're operating in a [border-box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) model, where the padding is counted as part of the size of an element.
  * Padding is incompressible.
  * Gaps are implemented as if we're injecting spacers between all children.

### Units​

There are two supported units:

  * `px`: device-independent pixels
  * `%`: percent of parent container's available content area (i.e. subtracting the parent's padding and gaps)

### Intrinsic size​

All elements have an _intrinsic size_. This is the size that they would be if there were no sizing modifiers applied to them.

  * **HStack** : Sum of the intrinsic widths of the children × the max of the intrinsic heights of the children (+ gaps and padding)
  * **VStack** : Max of the intrinsic widths of the children × the sum of the intrinsic heights of the children (+ gaps and padding)
  * **ZStack** : Max of the intrinsic sizes of the children (+ padding)
  * **Text** : Size of the text without wrapping or truncation
  * **Button** : Size of the text without wrapping or truncation (+ padding)
  * **Spacer** : Size in pixels, as specified
  * **Image** : imageWidth × imageHeight

This size provides a baseline, which can be modified by attributes. There are a few sizing attributes:

  * `width` / `height`
  * `minWidth` / `minHeight`
  * `maxWidth` / `maxHeight`
  * `grow` (operates in the _current direction_).

note

Setting both `width` and `grow` simultaneously is not recommended, because then `grow` would become a no-op (overridden by `width`).

### Preferred size​

The preferred size is calculated based on the intrinsic size and the modifier attributes. The modifiers can conflict, in which case the precedence order is:

`(most important) minWidth > maxWidth > width > aspect-ratio > grow > intrinsic width (least important)`

Here, `grow` attempts to set `width="100%"`. Unlike actually setting `width="100%"`, `grow` can be flexibly adjusted later. Examples:

  * `<text width="50px" grow />` will always have a preferred size of 50px. (width overrides `grow`)
  * `<text minWidth="50px" grow />` will always take at least 50px, and will attempt to consume the available `width`.

### Adjusted size​

Grow elements are flexible. Whenever the full width (or height) of a parent element is not fully utilized, a grow element will expand to fit the parent element, assuming that the other constraints permit. Grow is prioritized lower than the other sizing attributes, e.g. an element will never grow beyond its maxWidth.

### Direction​

All elements inherit a direction for the purposes of growing. Things only grow in one direction at a time.

Element| Self Direction| Child Direction| Blocks| N/A| Vertical| [HStack](/docs/blocks/stacks)| Inherit| Horizontal| [VStack](/docs/blocks/stacks)| Inherit| Vertical| [ZStack](/docs/blocks/stacks)| Inherit| Inherit| [Text](/docs/blocks/text)| Horizontal| N/A| [Button](/docs/blocks/button)| Horizontal| N/A| [Spacer](/docs/blocks/spacer)| Inherit| N/A| [Image](/docs/blocks/image)| Inherit| N/A  
---|---|---  
  
### Overflow​

All containers clip overflown content.
