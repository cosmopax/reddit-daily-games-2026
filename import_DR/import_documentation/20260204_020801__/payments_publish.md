note

The Developer Platform team reviews and approves apps and their products before products can be sold.

To publish your app:

  1. Run `devvit publish`.
  2. Select how you want your app to appear in the Apps directory:

  * **Unlisted** means that the app is only visible to you in the directory, and you can install your app on larger subreddits that you moderate.
  * **Public** means that your app is visible to all users in the Apps directory and can be installed by mods and admins across Reddit.

You can change your app visibility at any time. See publishing an app for details.

### Ineligible products​

Any apps or products for which you wish to enable payments must comply with our [Earn Policy](/docs/earn-money/reddit_developer_funds#terms-and-conditions) and [Devvit Guidelines](/docs/devvit_rules).
