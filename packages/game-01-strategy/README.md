# NEON SYNDICATE TYCOON (Get Rich Lazy)

> **cosmopax | Total Gamification**

A character-first daily idle strategy game for Reddit: run contracts, unlock advisors, and compound your influence.

## How To Play (Works Without API Keys)
1. Install the app on a subreddit.
2. In the subreddit menu, run: `Open/Create Today's Neon Syndicate Post`.
3. Open the created post and play the daily episode.

Tip: Pin the daily post for a clean "arcade cabinet" feel.

## Gameplay
- Pick 1 of 2 daily contracts (instant reward + 24h income boost)
- Buy assets to generate passive hourly income
- Unlock advisors automatically as your net worth grows
- Climb the subreddit leaderboard by net worth

## API Keys (Optional Enhancements)
Keys are optional. The game is fully playable without them.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional: enhanced flavor in future episodes |

## Configure Keys
Use the installation settings UI on developers.reddit.com (recommended). The CLI `devvit settings set` can be blocked by Reddit backend limitations.
