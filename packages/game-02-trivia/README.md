# HIVE MIND: TREND HEIST (Hyper Hive Minds)

> **cosmopax | Total Gamification**

A daily intel puzzle: pick higher/lower, justify the choice, and build streaks.

## How To Play (Works Without API Keys)
1. Install the app on a subreddit.
2. In the subreddit menu, run: `Open/Create Today's Trend Heist Post`.
3. Open the created post and play the daily heist.

## Gameplay
- Compare two daily signals (trends)
- Guess whether Signal B is higher or lower than Signal A
- Choose a reason (flavor) and share your result string in comments
- Build streaks and climb the leaderboard

## API Keys (Optional Enhancements)
Keys are optional. Without keys, the game uses curated, deterministic daily signals.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `SERPAPI_KEY` | Fetching real Google Trends data |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional: enhanced hints (future) |

## Configure Keys
Use the installation settings UI on developers.reddit.com (recommended). The CLI `devvit settings set` can be blocked by Reddit backend limitations.
