# MEME WARS: NEON FORGE

> **cosmopax | Total Gamification**

Daily meme battles for Reddit with a keyless caption mode (always works) and optional AI image generation.

## How To Play (Works Without API Keys)
1. Install the app on a subreddit.
2. In the subreddit menu, run: `Open/Create Today's Neon Forge Post`.
3. Submit a caption and vote on the best ones.

## Gameplay
- Caption Battle (always works): submit a caption, vote, and climb the board
- AI Image Forge (optional): queue an AI generation prompt and vote on results

## API Keys (Optional Enhancements)
Keys are optional. Caption Battle is the primary mode and needs no keys.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` | Optional: AI image generation |

## Configure Keys
Use the installation settings UI on developers.reddit.com (recommended). The CLI `devvit settings set` can be blocked by Reddit backend limitations.
