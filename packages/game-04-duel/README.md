# VALKYRIE ARENA: DUEL OF MINDS (Outsmarted Again)

> **cosmopax | Total Gamification**

A narrative duel with a reliable keyless opponent brain. Keys enhance dialogue only.

## How To Play (Works Without API Keys)
1. Install the app on a subreddit.
2. In the subreddit menu, run: `Open/Create Today's Valkyrie Arena Post`.
3. Execute moves and survive the arena.

## Gameplay
- Big, mobile-friendly duel UI with suggested moves
- AI opponent always responds (deterministic fallback avoids "Static Noise")
- Wins increment your global leaderboard score

## API Keys (Optional Enhancements)
Keys are optional. The duel is fully playable without them.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional: enhanced opponent moves |
| `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` | Optional: enhanced portrait generation (future) |

## Configure Keys
Use the installation settings UI on developers.reddit.com (recommended). The CLI `devvit settings set` can be blocked by Reddit backend limitations.
