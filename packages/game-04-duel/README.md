# OUTSMARTED AGAIN

> **Part of the 2026 Reddit Daily Games Portfolio by cosmopax labs**

**Outsmarted Again** is a category-based trivia game where you go head-to-head against an AI opponent. Each round reveals a new topic — from History to Pop Culture to Technology — and you choose your risk level before answering. Play it safe for a guaranteed point, or go hard for triple the reward.

## How It Works

1. **Category Reveal** — Each round presents a random category (History, Science, Pop Culture, Geography, Sports, Technology).
2. **Choose Your Difficulty** — Pick Easy (+1 pt), Normal (+2 pts), or Hard (+3 pts). The harder the question, the bigger the payoff.
3. **Answer the Question** — Four multiple-choice options. Think fast.
4. **See How the AI Did** — The AI independently picks its own difficulty and answers its own question. After each round, you see how both of you performed.
5. **Final Showdown** — After 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins. A full round-by-round breakdown shows every decision made.

## Why It's Fun

- **Risk vs. Reward** — Do you play it safe or gamble on hard questions for more points? The AI does the same, so strategy matters as much as knowledge.
- **270 Handcrafted Questions** — 15 questions per category per difficulty level, all factual and carefully balanced. No repeats within a game.
- **The AI Is No Pushover** — It picks its own difficulty (weighted toward normal) and has accuracy that scales with difficulty. It's beatable, but never a guaranteed win.
- **Quick Sessions** — A full game takes about 2 minutes. Perfect for a Reddit scroll break.
- **Leaderboard** — Win games to climb the Trivia Champions rankings. Share your results in the comments.
